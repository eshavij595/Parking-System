# Smart Parking Management System

This project focuses on developing an efficient parking space management system designed for both customers and managers. 
The system includes functionalities such as booking, editing, and extending parking reservations, as well as viewing parking rates and profiles. 
Customers can log in, register, and view available parking lots, each containing up to 100 spaces. 
Managers have additional controls to enable, disable, add, or delete parking spaces and parking lots. 
A dynamic GUI ensures easy navigation, allowing users to manage bookings, view parking availability, and handle member profiles. 
The system aims to streamline parking operations, providing a user-friendly interface and robust management tools for seamless parking space utilization.
